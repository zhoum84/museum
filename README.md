To run the database:
1. Download XAMPP
2. Run Apache + MySQL - this should open phpmyadmin
3. Create a new database called "museum" (important)
4. Copy paste table creation + population of tables from museum.sql and run the SQL command in phpmyadmin

To run the backend:
1. npm install
2. node app.js (we should rename this later)

To run the frontend:
1. cd client
2. npm install
3. npm start

what works:
 - press on search button and just press "search"
 - it will pull up all museums
Todo: 
 - Make css look pretty
 - make pages for each query
 - make corresponding backend functionality for these queries
